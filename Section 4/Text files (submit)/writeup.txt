Code Explanation:
------------------

Models (Student, Subject, Classes):
In the Models folder, three model classes (Student, Subject, Classes) are defined, each representing a core entity in the school management system.
Each model class includes properties that correspond to attributes of the respective entity.

Controller:
The heart of the application's CRUD functionality lies in the controllers. The code automates the creation of controllers using scaffolding.
The developer chooses a model (Student) and specifies the associated data context (SchoolDbContext).
Additionally, the developer provides a controller name (StudentController) and can opt to generate views along with the controller.

Data Context (SchoolDbContext):
The SchoolDbContext class, derived from DbContext, serves as the database context for the application. 
It establishes a connection to the database and includes DbSet properties for each model class.
The constructor of SchoolDbContext specifies the connection string, which is crucial for connecting to the underlying SQL Server database.

Generated Views:
Scaffolding generates views for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for the chosen model (Student).
The generated views include HTML forms and UI elements for interacting with the data, allowing administrators to add, view, edit, and delete student records.

Testing the Application:
After generating the controllers and views, developers can build and run the application.
