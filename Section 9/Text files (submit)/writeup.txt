Project Overview:
-----------------
This project is about creating an ASP.NET Web API to manage student subject marks for Rainbow School. 
The API will enable teachers to add, update, and delete subject marks for existing students using their mobile phones. 

Code Explanation:
------------------
Step 1: Setting Up the Project
API will serve as the backend for the mobile app, allowing teachers to interact with student data.

Step 2: Database Configuration
To manage student data, Entity Framework Core is used to connect to a SQL Server database. 

Step 3: Creating API Endpoints
A controller named SubjectMarksController is created to define API endpoints. 
These endpoints correspond to actions that teachers can perform on student subject marks. 
Key CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are implemented for subject marks within this controller.
For example, there's an AddSubjectMark endpoint that allows teachers to add a new subject mark for a student. 
This is done through an HTTP POST request that sends subject mark data to the API.

Step 4: Database Migrations
Entity Framework Migrations are used to manage the database schema. 
Migrations help in creating and updating the database based on the defined models ( subject mark) and their relationships.

Step 5: Testing
To ensure the API's functionality, testing is performed using tools like Swagger. 
Teachers can simulate the process of adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving subject marks to verify that the API behaves as expected.
