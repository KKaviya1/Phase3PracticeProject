Introduction:
-------------
ASP.NET MVC application has been developed to help Rainbow School analyze and display statistics based on the marks obtained by students in a class. 
The application utilizes the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to efficiently manage data and user interface components. 
Using LINQ, the application calculates and presents various statistics, including the average marks obtained by students.

Model - Student.cs:
A model class, Student, represents student data with properties such as Id, Name, and Marks.
create another model class StudentStatistics

Controller - StudentsController.cs:
The StudentsController is responsible for handling user requests and coordinating data retrieval and presentation.
It contains sample student data, which can be replaced with a database or dynamic data source.
Actions in this controller calculate and display statistics.
The AverageMarks action calculates the average marks obtained by students using LINQ's Average method.

Views:
Views are responsible for rendering the user interface.
The application has a view named Stats.cshtml inside the "Students" folder, which displays the average marks to the user.

Users can access the application by running it in a web browser.
The application can be expanded to include more statistics, such as highest and lowest marks, by adding additional actions in the controller and corresponding views.

Conclusion:
ASP.NET MVC application provides Rainbow School with a user-friendly interface to analyze student performance statistics efficiently. 
It serves as a foundation for further enhancements and customization, making it a valuable tool for educational institutions to gain insights into their students' academic performanc
