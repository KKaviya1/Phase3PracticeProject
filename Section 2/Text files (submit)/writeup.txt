EXPLANATION:
------------
Section starts by creating a new database named "School" and then switches to using that database for the subsequent operations.
Code creates a table named "Students" with columns to store student information, including student ID, first name, last name, date of birth, and gender. 
The student ID is the primary key, ensuring uniqueness for each student record.
Code creates a table named "Subjects" to store information about academic subjects. 
Code creates a table named "Classes" to manage class information. 
Create indexes on specific columns to improve query performance.
The indexes are named idx_LastName for the "LastName" column in the "Students" table, idx_SubjectName for the "SubjectName" column in the "Subjects" table, and idx_ClassID for the "ClassID" column in the "Classes" table.
Students' details, subject information, and class information are added using the provided INSERT statements.
Finally, retrieve all records from the "Students," "Subjects," and "Classes" tables, respectively.
